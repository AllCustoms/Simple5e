# Simple5e
A relatively simple-to-use first framework for playing 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons in MapTool. Tinker friendly, this framework includes built-in help features and is designed to be a foundation for your game.

This repository is a place for me to let others to check out the work in progress and download individual pieces of the framework. For official releases of my framework, please visit the thread on the RPTools forums:
