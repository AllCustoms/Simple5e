## Recommended Addons
- [Bobifle's Drop-in 5e Monsters](https://github.com/bobifle/tokens). All the Basic Rules monsters and monsters from the Tome of Beasts. Optional support for these tokens is built into the Simple5e campaign file.
- [Merudo's 5e Spell Library](https://github.com/Merudo/spell-library/releases/latest). This addon requires MapTool 1.6.1+, and will give you instant access to nearly every 5e spell. It is HIGHLY recommended!
- [Illydth's Spell States](https://github.com/Illydth/issSpellStates). Keep MUCH better track of spell effects and get a bunch of additional, well thought-out utility states and campaign macros. This addon requires MapTool 1.6.1+. Simple5e 2.2+ includes all the Campaign Token Properties and States needed so all you need are the tokens and tables. If you want your states to all follow the same aesthetic Illydth has both provided instructions and bundled versions of Simple5e with Spell States for you (and even ones with Bag of Tricks!).

### Download Version 1.3
This version is even simpler and easier to hack around on than 2.0, but rougher around the edges.
- [Version 1.3 Campaign File](https://github.com/melek/Simple5e/raw/master/Version%201.3/Meleks%20Simple%205e%20v1.3.cmpgn)
- [Version 1.3 Parts](Version%201.3/)

### Custom Counters
If you are interested in the 'Custom Counters' functionality in this framework, this feature is generic enough for any game and has been made into a generic, drop-in library token version:
